# network-port-scanner
A Python-based tool for scanning active hosts and identifying open ports on a network, developed during a cybersecurity internship.
# Network and Port Scanner 🛡️

This project is a Network and Port Scanner developed during my 3-month cybersecurity internship at Threat Prism One Stop AI. It scans local or custom IP ranges and identifies open ports, helping with reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment.

## 📌 Project Features
- Scans a user-defined IP address or range
- Detects active hosts on the network
- Identifies open ports using socket programming
- Outputs clean, user-friendly results

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- `socket` module
- `ipaddress` and `subprocess` libraries

## 📄 Documentation
Full report and technical details are available in [Network_Port_Scanner_Report.pdf](./Network_Port_Scanner_Report.pdf).

## 🚀 Impact
Improved early-stage reconnaissance processes by automating IP and port discovery, allowing faster vulnerability assessments during internships.
